## Getting Started

## Deployment

The react app[1] is deployed on netlify[2]. The code was first hosted on GitLab and then on GitHub and lastly the netlify account was linked with repository from github.At the end, the web application was deployed in few moements and  then if are any changes then netlify automatically build the react application and deploy it 


## Built With

<!--- Provide a list of the frameworks used to build this application, your list should include the name of the framework used, the url where the framework is available for download and what the framework was used for, see the example below --->

* Framework that I used - [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

## Sources Used

According to the requirement of the assignment for creating front-end, I have used the boilerplate code for the basic react app working[1].
The remaining code is developed by referring the documentation and articles from[3],[4],[5],[6]. For the front-end validations I have used regular expressions [7],[8],[9].
